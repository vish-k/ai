# AI Experiments & Research Lab

This repository serves as my personal laboratory for exploring and experimenting with various cutting-edge AI technologies, focusing on areas like Generative AI, Agentic AI, and Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## 🗂 Project Catalog

### 1. Generative AI
- **[Stable Diffusion Implementation](./stable-diffusion/README.md)**
  - Text-to-image generation optimized for Apple Silicon
  - Uses Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) for hardware acceleration
  - Example: Generating creative images from text prompts

### 2. Agentic AI (Planned)
- Autonomous AI agents that can:
  - Perform complex tasks through decomposition
  - Interact with their environment
  - Make decisions and learn from outcomes
- Implementation examples:
  - Task planning and execution
  - Multi-agent collaboration
  - Environment interaction

### 3. Model Context Protocol (MCP) (Planned)
- Framework for AI model interaction
- Standardized communication protocols
- Context management and optimization
- Future implementations:
  - MCP server setup
  - Model integration examples
  - Context handling patterns

## 🎯 Goals

1. **Experimentation**: Test and validate different AI approaches and technologies
2. **Learning**: Document insights and learnings from each implementation
3. **Innovation**: Combine different technologies to create novel solutions
4. **Sharing**: Provide clear documentation and examples for others to learn from
